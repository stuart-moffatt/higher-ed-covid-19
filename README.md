# Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States related to Colleges and Universities

## Data

The first data set presented here is a List of Colleges’ Plans for Reopening in the Fall as published by The Chronicle of Higher Education. 
The Chronicle owns the data but provides links to download it. Unfortunately, the downloaded CSV has some issues with line breaks
which prevent it being a "clean" data set for use in further analysis.
